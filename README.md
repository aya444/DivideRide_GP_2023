# DivideRide - Carpooling Application

It specifically focuses on employees within the same company who encounter these difficulties. The application enables users to share rides, whether they own a car or not, and share the expenses of gasoline. By connecting users from the same organization, DivideRide promotes cost savings, reduces traffic congestion, minimizes carbon emissions, and fosters a sense of community among colleagues.
